# Debug Notes

## Fixed Issues
1. Added missing service imports:
   - PlatformService
   - DAOService

## Project Structure Cleanup
1. Main bot implementation is now centralized in `Discord Bot/bot.js`
2. Package.json updated to point to correct file locations
3. Redundant files removed or marked for removal

## Required Dependencies
All core dependencies are present in package.json:
- discord.js
- dotenv
- Required service modules

## Next Steps
1. Test the bot initialization:
   ```bash
   npm install
   npm run dev
   ```

2. Verify command handling:
   - Help command
   - Ping command
   - Echo command

3. Monitor for any runtime errors

## Environment Setup
Make sure to:
1. Copy .env.example to .env
2. Set up required environment variables:
   - DISCORD_TOKEN
   - Other service-specific variables

## Testing
Run tests using:
```bash
npm test
```

## Additional Notes
- The bot uses intents: Guilds, GuildMessages, MessageContent
- Command handler is properly initialized
- Error handling is in place for message processing
